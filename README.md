# Twokinds Viewer v0.1
A android app meant to be a front end for the webcomic Twokinds. 

## Featurs

* Can view "most" of the Twokinds webcomic

## Main problems

* Every comic page before 2019 has been formatted in JPG while everything during and after 2019 has been formatted as PNG this creates a problem in the current indexing code where anything during and after 2019 will not be found.

## What needs to be worked on

* The entire design of the application
* A way to save the indexed photos so the application does not have to index them every time it runs.
